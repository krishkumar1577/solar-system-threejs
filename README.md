# Solar System Simulation - Three.js

A mobile-responsive, interactive 3D simulation of the solar system built with Three.js and plain JavaScript that meets all Frontend Developer Assignment requirements.

## 🌍 Project Overview
This project displays a realistic 3D solar system simulation with:
- **Sun at the center** with proper lighting
- **All 8 planets** (Mercury to Neptune) orbiting with realistic properties
- **Real-time orbital speed control** for each planet
- **Interactive camera controls** and planet focusing
- **Mobile-responsive design** that works on all devices

## ✨ Features
- **3D Solar System**: Realistic Sun and 8 planets with proper scaling and colors
- **Dynamic Animations**: Smooth orbital movements using Three.js animation loop
- **Interactive Controls**: Real-time speed adjustment sliders for each planet
- **Pause/Resume**: Animation control functionality
- **Planet Tooltips**: Hover over planets to see their names
- **Camera Focus**: Click on planets to zoom in, click Sun to reset view
- **Starry Background**: Beautiful particle-based star field
- **Mobile Responsive**: Adapts to all screen sizes and orientations

## 🎮 Controls
- **Speed Sliders**: Adjust orbital speed for each planet in real-time
- **Pause/Resume Button**: Stop or start the entire animation
- **Mouse Hover**: See planet names via tooltips
- **Mouse Click**: 
  - Click on a planet to focus the camera on it
  - Click on the Sun to return to default view
  - Click empty space to reset camera

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository
